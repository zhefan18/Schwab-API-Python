Some important notes from zfan:

* To install this API, I used this command
  ** pip install schwabdev --break-system-packages
  ** This is because without --break-system-packages it would not allow me to install it. And the other workarounds seem complicated to me.

* Then from example dir, I ran python3 api_demo.py
  ** Note that in the last step, it will give me a link and ask me to connect and authorize it.
  ** From that link, it will send me to the callback url 127.0.0.1, and the browser will tell me that 127.0.0.1 cannot be connected.
  ** But this is OK! I just need to paste the https://127.0.0.1/?code=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX link to the running python program, and it will continue. And everything works from here.

* I also made a change so that .env is from a separate dir, so we won't mistakenly check it into github. 
    dotenv_path = Path('/home/zfan/schwab_api_secret/.env')
    load_dotenv(dotenv_path = dotenv_path)
